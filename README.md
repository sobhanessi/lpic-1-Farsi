# lpic-1-Farsi

This is clone of LPIC-1 in lpi.org website in Farsi

in this repo I'm going to translate lpi's tutorials into Farsi that these people can benefit from this Kernel and take advantage of it.
this repo is in the way to help open source society and free software society.
if anyone interested in helping me in this project, please contact me via sobhanessi@gmail.com.
